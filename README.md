## Example usage

```Cpp
#include "nonstd/jthread.hpp"
#include <iostream>

int main(int argc, char **)
{
    int product = 0;
    const int six = 6;
    const int seven = 7;

    {
        nonstd::jthread thr{[&](int x, int y){ product = x * y; }, six, seven };

        // automatically join thread here, making sure it has executed:
    }

    std::cout << "Product of "<< six << " and " << seven << " is " << product << ".\n";
}
```

### Compile and run

```Text
$ g++ -std=c++11 -Wall -I../include/ -o 02-arguments.exe 02-arguments.cpp && 02-arguments.exe
Product of 6 and 7 is 42.
```

## In a nutshell

**jthread lite** is a single-file header-only library to provide [C++20's class jthread](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/thread/jthread) for use with C++11 and later. If available, the standard library is used, unless [configured](#configuration) otherwise.

Currently `nonstd::jthread` does not (yet) support thread cancellation using [`stop_token`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/thread/stop_token), [`stop_source`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/thread/stop_source) and [`stop_callback`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/thread/stop_callback). It also does not support [`std::condition_variable_any`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/thread/condition_variable_any).

**Features and properties of jthread lite** are ease of installation (single header), freedom of dependencies other than the standard library.

**Limitations of jthread lite** are ... \[*to be summed up*\].

## License

*jthread lite* is distributed under the [Boost Software License](https://github.com/martinmoene/jthread-lite/blob/master/LICENSE.txt).

## Dependencies

*jthread lite* has no other dependencies than the [C++ standard library](http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/header).

## Installation

*jthread lite* is a single-file header-only library. Put `jthread.hpp` in the [include](include) folder directly into the project source tree or somewhere reachable from your project.

- [Configuration](#configuration)

### Documentation of class jthread

\[*Envisioned*\] Depending on the compiler and C++ standard used, *jthread lite* behaves less or more like the standard's version. To get an idea of the capabilities of *jthread lite* with your configuration, look at the output of the [tests](test/jthread.t.cpp), issuing `jthread-main.t --pass @`.

For the standard's documentation, see [`class jthread`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/thread/jthread), which is part of the [C++ thread library](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/thread).

### Configuration

#### Tweak header

If the compiler supports [`__has_include()`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/preprocessor/include), *jthread lite* supports the [tweak header](https://vector-of-bool.github.io/2020/10/04/lib-configuration.html) mechanism. Provide your *tweak header* as `nonstd/jthread.tweak.hpp` in a folder in the include-search-path. In the tweak header, provide definitions as documented below, like `#define jthread_CPLUSPLUS 201103L`.

### Select `std::jthread` or `nonstd::jthread`

\[*To be implemented*\]

At default, *jthread lite* uses `std::jthread` if it is available and lets you use it via namespace `nonstd`. You can however override this default and explicitly request to use `std::jthread` or jthread lite's `nonstd::jthread` as `nonstd::jthread` via the following macros.

-D<b>jthread\_CONFIG\_SELECT\_JTHREAD</b>=jthread\_SELECT\_JTHREAD\_NONSTD  
Define this to `jthread__CONFIG_SELECT_JTHREAD_STD` to select `std::jthread` as `nonstd::jthread`. Define this to `jthread_SELECT_JTHREAD_NONSTD` to select `nonstd::jthread` as `nonstd::jthread`. Default is undefined, which has the same effect as defining to `jthread_SELECT_JTHREAD_NONSTD` currently (this may change to `jthread_SELECT_JTHREAD_DEFAULT`).

#### Standard selection macro

\-D<b>jthread\_CPLUSPLUS</b>=199711L  
Define this macro to override the auto-detection of the supported C++ standard, if your compiler does not set the `__cplusplus` macro correctly.

#### Disable exceptions

-D<b>jthread_CONFIG_NO_EXCEPTIONS</b>=0
Define this to 1 if you want to compile without exceptions. If not defined, the header tries and detect if exceptions have been disabled (e.g. via `-fno-exceptions`). Default is undefined.
